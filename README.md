Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates:

Data Architecture Design – Structured multi-layered data warehouse using SQL Server schemas (bronze, silver, gold).
ETL Development – Automated extraction, transformation, and loading using T-SQL stored procedures.
Data Modeling – Built a Star Schema for business-ready datasets (dimensions & facts).
Data Quality Management – Implemented validation and integrity checks across layers.
Documentation & Cataloging – Created data catalogs, ER diagrams, and architecture visuals.
Project Features
Data Warehouse Development
Integrated multiple data sources (ERP and CRM) into SQL Server.
Used BULK INSERT and stored procedures to automate data ingestion.
Created layered schemas (bronze, silver, gold) for maintainable pipelines.
ETL Workflow
Extracted data from CSVs and loaded it into staging (bronze) tables.
Transformed data in silver layer (cleaning, standardizing, normalizing).
Created gold layer views representing fact and dimension tables.
Data Quality Checks
Applied validation to detect nulls, duplicates, and invalid data.
Ensured referential integrity between dimension and fact tables.
Built SQL scripts to monitor data completeness and consistency.
Documentation and Governance
Designed architecture, data flow, and data model diagrams.
Created a data catalog describing each table and column in the gold layer.
Followed consistent naming conventions and schema standards.
